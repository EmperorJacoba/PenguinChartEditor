# Welcome to the future of charting!

Penguin Chart Editor is a work-in-progress chart editing software for Guitar Hero/Rock Band-style rhythm games, that will support five-fret and six-fret guitar-based instruments, 
four-lane and eight-lane (Elite) drums, and most importantly, **Vocals/Harmonies gamemodes**. Pro Keys is a reach goal, pro guitar/bass & 5L drums are not planned but are considered.

Unlike other chart editors, Penguin separates the stages of chart editing into distinctive "tabs," each structured to best achieve a certain task.  
This method of chart editing is inspired by Steinberg's Dorico, a program used for creating sheet music.

## An important note about Penguin

### **Please do not submit issues or pull requests at this time. If you have any feature requests, questions, feedback, or want to contribute, please join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/z2UTt2p6uM) and contact Emperor.**

Penguin is **still in development**, and no built version of Penguin exists yet. I hope to have an alpha version of Penguin released by **March-April 2026**. 
**Please star and watch this repository to get notifications when I (eventually) release builds!**

The first version (version 0.1.0-alpha) of Penguin will include the following:

- **Song setup**/metadata tab (enter in song metadata, audio stems, etc)
- **Tempo Map** tab (set beatline positions and time signature changes)
- **Chart** tab with support for five-fret instruments (guitar, bass, coop guitar, rhythm, keys)
- **Starpower/Sections** tab (set starpower for instruments, lay down practice sections)
- **Export** tab (create chart directory/file/folder as .zip or .chart)

Files will be saved as .penguin, a file format that mirrors the data structure of Penguin.

In following versions (roughly in this order - no promises), more features will be added:

- Undo/Redo
- Customizable keybinds/settings - including Lefty Flip
- .mid support: importing and exporting
- ***Vocal charting***
- Pro drum charting
- Bookmarks (local editor sections)
- Elite drum charting
- Six-fret (GHL) charting
- RB3/YARG venue, lighting, and character animation editing tab
- Linux support

Plus other major & minor features not listed. Planned features are usually outlined as an issue in the [issues tab](https://github.com/EmperorJacoba/PenguinChartEditor/issues).
