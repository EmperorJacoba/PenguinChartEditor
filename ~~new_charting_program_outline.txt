charting program set up like dorico
FLOWCHART & SKETCH ALL IDEAS BEFORE ATTEMPTING
make sure a variety of existing charts open correctly in program

tabs: 	song setup | tempo map | chart | star power | sections | preview | export | stats | settings- use alt+something to navigate tabs

song setup = 	song properties, audio setup, ini setup, etc - add support for embedding album art and background within app & proper sizing/filetype
		also have indirect song.ini editing through text boxes, direct song.ini editing is under an advanced option
		explain what "drums" + "drums_1" + "drums_2" etc mean in audio setup
		import metadata from file/existing audio file?
		play chart preview in app, use slider/timestamp to select

tempo map = 	basic highway (no instrument), fine-tune precision needed, low opacity barlines?
		have no projection - no track warping - straight rectangle
		ability to adjust height/intensity of waveform
		metronome sound
		timesignature setup: do not allow misaligned timesignatures - automatically fix when mistake is made
		don't require control to move, but allow option to lock bpm marker
		do not have bpm number on beatline, put it off to the side
		have bpm marker in middle of screen to be able to see what you just mapped
		allow adjustment of waveform peaks for accurate mapping (slide between big peaks (audacity) and small peaks (moonscraper mode))
		spectrogram is useful apparently?
		anchors are unintuitive - should work out automatically
			every bpm marker is an anchor until editing in front of it?

		when calculating distance between beatlines, remember hyperspeed - figure out calculations for clone hero/yarg and match that
		distance between beatlines is what varies

chart = 	placing notes - includes drum rolls & vocals (including unpitched lyrics) - 
		needs all difficulty support - have easy, available button to copy down difficulty - must have warning that chart will be deleted
		have nps calculator there - select notes & it calculates it for you as opposed to step-based calculation
		INCLUDES VOCAL CHARTING
		have volume adjusting in-window, no going through dialog boxes
		play mode MUST have disappearing notes at bottom in sync with track like moonscraper
		have markers for forced notes, BUT make sure it is separate from hopo/tap marker
		allow for instrument specific sections, separate from practice sections
		open notes over other notes/chords is a new feature to be allowed
		
starpower = 	placing starpower phrases, maybe have all instruments* side-by-side to allow for unison phrases/lining up phrases?
		unison phrases
		show measures since last phrase - implement guidelines from smoochum's star power guide
		automatically bring down star power between difficulties
		shift between difficulties in case difficulty specific edits are wanted

sections = 	place sections with all instruments visible*

preview = 	view chart moonscraper style, select difficulties, etc
		export chart preview videos (secondary)

		idea: like moonscraper preview, but camera over perspective track with ability to see flat top-down chart preview?

export = 	self explanatory - "export" in moonscraper - export as standard .opus files + standard specifications (

stats = 	stats section from moonscraper BUT add other things too
		notes per instrument - total notes
		star power amount per instrument - total star power
		local events per instrument - total local events
		average BPM
		number of BPM markers
		number of TS changes
		number of global flags
		add stats from CHopt - total score w & w/o star power, maximum average multiplier, etc, per instrument & for all instruments
		how long the user has spent charting a song

settings = 	MS settings clone
		calibration
		keybinds

first time setup - set sustain gap, calibration, colors, etc

lyrics/vocals in "chart" section - set up like lyric editor in moonscraper, but drag lyrics as flag over audio file b/c of usual imprecision
		import lyrics like moonscraper - give waveform of audio file (presumably isolated vocals), and have user drag flags onto waveform to set lyric events
		add pitch & sustain to lyric events

interface: 	vocals set up like gameplay (left to right scrolling w/ lyrics & pitch // daw)
		guitar, drums, bass set up top down like highway
		add support for charting true/elite drums
		add .chart support for vocals BUT also allow exporting to .mid files - find out how moonscraper does this for usual notes

needs support for keys mode
needs song validator
needs roll lanes for all instruments (secondary)
	roll lanes for drums primary
needs metronome
needs "clap" (better sound, please!!)
needs calibration - use window/gameplay to avoid need for typing in random numbers
	also figure out why calibration is needed, what it does, why it happens
needs spectrogram
needs lefty flip
needs hyperspeed options
needs side track view for quick navigation like moonscraper
needs "quick export" to custom folder for playtesting in ch/yarg
needs timer for how long user has worked on song
NEEDS EQ like in media player
needs right + left click to delete
needs drag to select
needs basic keybinds
needs chart checklist to keep track of what's been done
needs rclick + lclick delete
needs shortcut to delete bar
needs shortcut to set sustain to max
copy and paste should persist between instances
	temporarily save selection (notes & distance between them) in data file? Would also persist between openings

keybinds to switch between instrument audios (tempo map)
keybind to place section/marker
keybind to select all notes in front of/behind selection
keybind to max out sustain (extended/nonextended sustain modes)

count time in beats/measure and seconds

tie charting projects to folders to avoid audio problems, everything should stay in a single folder

charting mode: each note/chord can snap to another to sample sound for consistency
		example: r/y chord: click on it, see other r/y chords close by in chart or in similar sections to compare sounds
		alternative: link chords/notes/sections that you know are the same pitch

needs ability to export as .sng (secondary)

needs GHL charting (secondary, who uses that, exactly?)
needs support for RB/Yarg venue/character control flags (look at rbn documentation) (secondary)

prep audio in the app (leading/lagging silence, .opus, etc) (secondary)

double-click to select chord (or use shift)

copy shortcuts from moonscraper controls menu, make non-obvious/standard ones better

NO SUPPORT FOR PLAYTESTING IN-APP : 	DUMB AND WEIRD AND STUPID AND WEIRD AND DUMB
					JUST EXPORT IT QUICK INTO YARG OR USE CLAP???


.mid files - HOW?


have track speed function same as moonscraper - but speed is navigable by keyboard instead of slider - "automatic pitch correction"

* = select instruments to view, like a parts score
