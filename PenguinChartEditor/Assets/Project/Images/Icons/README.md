# Yarg Instrument Icons

These instrument icons are taken from the [YARG repository](https://github.com/YARC-Official/YARG/blob/master/Assets/Art/Menu/Common/InstrumentIcons.png), as of 1/10/26. These icons are used to label instruments in various interfaces within Penguin. 

Coop and Rhythm icons are taken from [YARG repository, commit 84a04e87683635f678dc222645ce482e4ae06f9c](https://github.com/YARC-Official/YARG/blob/84a04e87683635f678dc222645ce482e4ae06f9c/Assets/Art/UI/FontSprites.png). I feel the newer icons are less
clear, especially during chart editing, and I personally disagree with their usage. Using the old coop and rhythm icons improves recognizability, because they have identifying text below them, instead of abstract different guitars. 
I do recognize that these icons look different (and are of lower image quality) than the rest of the set, so if anybody updates the icons to use the new design pattern (but keeps the coop and rhythm labels), I would not be opposed. Please do not just add the new icons back.
